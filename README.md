# LAZY, the Easiest Programming Language

Okay, probably not.  However, like many other contemporary programming languages, its main goal is to be as expressive as possible without sacrificing efficiency in exchange.  Fun fact: this language was originally intended as an esoteric language, but in making it I found the sharpest of sharp edges in the languages I tried to write the compiler in.  Rust gave me the most ease, however I believe I can bring in features and paradigms from other languages throughout history to make something even better.  A long shot for sure, but a fun project to work on nonetheless.  Wish me luck.
